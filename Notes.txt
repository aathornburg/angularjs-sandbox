Loading jQuery before Angular lets it use full jQuery instead of its built-in jQLite

We use the "ng-app" directive to declare our app in the HTML.
    We can do ng-app="myApp" or just ng-app without the value to declare the default app.  I'm doing that for this project.

We can have multiple scopes defined in our app using the "ng-controller" directive
